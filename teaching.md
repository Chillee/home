I previously taught:

* [Fall 2016: CS 4110, "Programming Languages and Logics."](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs4110/2016fa/) This is Cornell's undergraduate programming languages elective. It's full of content you'd find in a typical graduate PL course.

I will teach:

* Spring 2017: CS 6110, "Advanced Programming Languages."
