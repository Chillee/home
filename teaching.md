I previously taught:

* [Spring 2017: CS 6110, "Advanced Programming Languages."](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6110/2017sp/)
  This is our graduate programming languages course. 6110 is a "competency" course, which means that most PhD students will eventually take it.
* [Fall 2016: CS 4110, "Programming Languages and Logics."](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs4110/2016fa/)
  This is Cornell's undergraduate programming languages elective. 4110 is full of content you'd expect to find in a graduate PL course.

I will teach:

* Fall 2017: CS 2110, "Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures."
  This the second course in our department's introductory CS sequence. I am co-teaching with [David Gries](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/gries/).
* Spring 2018: CS 6110, "Advanced Programming Languages."
