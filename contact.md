Here are some answers to a couple of common questions.

* **Can you send me the slides for a talk you gave?**

  There are links to my talks in my [conference paper list][confpapers]. There are PDF versions there, and I can also send you Keynote files if you [email me][email]. I don't have PowerPoint files.

  If you're presenting a paper in a reading group, I'd love to hear a summary of the discussion!

* **I'm applying to grad school soon, and I'm interested in doing research with you!**

  Fantastic! I'm thrilled that you're interested in the same kinds of hardware--software abstraction problems that I am. Cornell is a great place to do a Ph.D. in computer science.

  Please [apply to the Ph.D. program at Cornell CS][csapply] or [in ECE][eceapply]. I'll look forward to reading your application to either department.
